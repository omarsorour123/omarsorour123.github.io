        Nisha has crossed oceans to give her child a future. Now she spends her days caring for someone else's daughter while her own waits for her return, half a world away.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        For Petra, it is only natural to hire a domestic worker to keep her house clean and her family fed. Their lives have nothing in common, except the love they feel for their daughters.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Then one day, Nisha vanishes. No one cares about the disappearance of a foreign domestic worker, except Petra and Nisha's secret lover, Yiannis, the only connection to her daughter back in Sri Lanka.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        As Petra and Yiannis desperately search for Nisha, they realise how little they knew about her. What they uncover will change them both forever.
