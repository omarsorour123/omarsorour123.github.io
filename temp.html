        If you're tired of being manipulated, whether you're being tricked into doing things you don't want, or others are taking advantage of you, there are ways to stop manipulation and persuasion in its tracks.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The first half of the book will discuss what makes up an individual. The way you use your body, the words that you choose to speak, and the way that they were raised all play important roles in what makes an individual. You will also have to look at your own self and pick out all of these unique things that make them different from everyone else as well.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        There are psychological studies that back up the idea of certain methods of persuasion, such as NLP tactics, that prove that anyone has the power to persuade others.
        <br>
        <br>

        Although there are many differences among people, there are also many things that make us the same. In order to better analyze and understand those around you, it's crucial to find those things that we do connect on, and the things that bring us together rather than the things that tear us apart.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        It's important when reading this book to remember that not all manipulation is bad. In the first book of this boxset, it is emphasized that those who might be manipulating you might also be taking advantage of you.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        When reading this book, you should remember that manipulation is a tool, much like a hammer. You can either use that hammer to destroy everything around you, or you could alternatively use that hammer to create something organic, something new.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        This book will take you first through the discovery and analyzation of those around you, and then it will provide different ways that you can persuade them.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The only thing you need before starting this book is the willingness to change. You might have to confront some of your darkest issues, and you might have to put yourself through future scenarios that elicit a feeling of discomfort. In the end, however, you'll find yourself to be much more self-aware and independent.
